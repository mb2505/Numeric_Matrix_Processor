# Numeric_Matrix_Processor
Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: it performs a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, 
finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices.

Example:

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: > 6
Enter matrix size: > 3 3
Enter matrix:
> 2 -1 0
> 0 1 2
> 1 1 0
The result is:
 0.33   0  0.33
-0.33   0  0.66
 0.16 0.5 -0.33
